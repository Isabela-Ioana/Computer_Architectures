Enhance the assembly program you created in the previous lab called program_1.s:  
 
int m = 1; 
float a, b; 
for (i = 31; i >= 0; i--) { 
    if (i is a multiple of 3) { 
        a = v1[i] / ((float) m << i); /*logic shift */ 
        m = (int) a; 
    } else {  
        a = v1[i] * ((float) m * i); 
        m = (int) a; 
    }    
    v4[i] = a * v1[i] - v2[i]; 
    v5[i] = v4[i]/v3[i] - b; 
    v6[i] = (v4[i]-v1[i]) * v5[i]; 
} 
  
a. Manually detect the different data, structural, and control hazards that cause a 
pipeline stall. Report at least 3 hazards in the code (or the pipeline).
b.Optimize the program by re-scheduling instructions to eliminate as many 
hazards as possible. Manually calculate the number of clock cycles for the new 
program (program_1_a.s) to execute and compare the results with those 
obtained by the simulator.
